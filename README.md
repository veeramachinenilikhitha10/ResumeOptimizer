üìù AI Resume Optimiser and Generator
üìå Overview
This is an AI-powered Resume Optimiser and Generator that takes:

Input: Candidate resume (PDF/DOCX) and a target job description (plain text)
Output: An optimised resume tailored to the job description with:
Missing keywords intelligently integrated into relevant sections
Original formatting preserved (for DOCX resumes)
ATS (Applicant Tracking System) compatibility enhancements
A brief change log explaining modifications
The goal is to increase your chances of passing ATS screening and align your resume more closely with the job requirements.

Features:
Prompt design: Interactive prompts request resume and job description filenames from the user
Multi-format support: Handles .docx and .pdf resumes
Resume parsing and editing automation: Automatically reads resumes, detects missing keywords, and integrates them into the correct sections
Job-market keyword optimisation: Extracts job description keywords and places them where they naturally fit (Skills, Experience, Projects)
Formatting preservation: Keeps the original DOCX layout intact
Change log generation: Outputs a change_log.txt summarising what was added and where

Preserve full PDF formatting with OCR/template mapping
Export directly to PDF format
